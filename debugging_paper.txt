I debugged the developing of thia part 2 of this project using Chrome's inspect features:

Console: here I printed simple console.log's messages to check my progress in what to I wanted to grab for example
the JSON object logic in the new experience page, this includes: what are the current contents of the JSON object,
and how to get the values inside it.

Application>Cookies: Here I can manage and keep track of my cookies made for the register and login pages logic, and
test the change in the experience page depending of which employer is currently logged in.

I had problems implementing a third party library for the password checker, since it's target "id=password" was
conflicting with the same target of Bootstrap, so I decided to go for a simple "hacky" regex implementation.

The tech rick editor tinyMCE was also conflicting with Bootstrap, and made the focus, blur functionality on the contact page on the textarea tedious.

For the data_worker.js file I could not load it on the js/webworker file correctly unless it was on the root folder.
